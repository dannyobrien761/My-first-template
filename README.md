# O'Brien Builders website
Project O'Brien Builders is intended for my dads business in the construction industry. He wants to move away from bigger cronstruction jobs of entire houses that he usually got from word of mouth to smaller day to day or week to week jobs that can be sourced through a online presece in his area.
O'Brien Builders construction target audience is built in its simplicity for older users who wouldn't be as computer literat as some of the younger generation. some features of simplicity include:
<ul>
<li>two page website</li>
<li>big writing </li>
<li>big buttons eg (nav bar , submit and reset on form)</li>
</ul>

## short comings and areas for future improvement
<ul>
<li>being more responsive needs more work on smaller screens and I would aim to improve this in future.
</li>
<li>Better structure in design stage, through the use of figma, how sizes of pictures and placement of content can be experimented with</li>
</ul>
